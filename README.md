# My Orders -

The Smart Product Verify Return & Refund System is a blockchain-based solution designed to ensure secure, transparent, and efficient product returns and refunds. Sellers register products, and each transaction generates a unique hash code.

Seller can pay 0.2 APT (fixed amount).

Once paid, the transaction hash is stored & displayed (like your screenshot).

It should also show items + payment status.

# Smart Product Verify Return & Refund System -
When a buyer returns a product, the delivery boy scans the QR code to view product details such as brand, product ID, and buyer address.

By verifying whether the product matches the original purchase, the system records the result on the blockchain.

# Sucess Transaction Product Match -

When the returned product matches the original purchase:
The system records a successful verification on the blockchain.
A transaction hash is generated for this match.
The hash is shared with the product owner (e.g., via WhatsApp) for secure confirmation.

# Failed Transaction Product MisMatch -

When the returned product does not match the original purchase:
The system records a failed verification on the blockchain.
A transaction hash is generated for this mismatch.

# WhatsApp QR Scanner
Instantly scan QR codes and connect seamlessly through WhatsApp with enhanced security

A transaction hash is then generated and shared with the product owner via WhatsApp for instant verification.

git clone https://github.com/jayaveerR/Decentralized-Return-RefundMechanism-Trust-Chai.git
cd Decentralized-Return-RefundMechanism-Trust-Chai
```
### 2. Install Dependencies
##### Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then run:
```
npm install
```
### 3. Setup Environment Variables
#### Copy the sample `.env` file:
```
cp .env.sample .env
```
### 4. Run the Development Server

)
#### 5. Build for Production (optional)
```
npm run build
```

### üîπ How the System Works

### 1.Order Placement
  * A buyer orders a product from an online platform (Flipkart, Amazon, Myntra, etc.).
  * The platform generates a unique Order ID for that purchase.

### 2.Seller Registration
   * Once the order is confirmed, the seller registers the product on the decentralized system.
   * Details stored on blockchain include:
       * Product ID
       * Order ID (unique to the buyer)
       * Brand Name
       * Seller‚Äôs Wallet Address
  * A Transaction Hash is generated after successful registration.

## 3.QR Code Creation
* The Transaction Hash is converted into a QR Code
* This QR Code is:
    * Printed and attached to the product (like a digital authenticity tag).
    * Shared with the buyer via WhatsApp/email for reference.
* A warning message is displayed:
  * ‚ÄúDo not remove this QR tag. If removed, return & refund will not be accepted.‚Äù

### 4.Delivery
 * The product is delivered to the buyer with the QR code attached.
 * The QR code ensures that the product is authentic and traceable.

### 5.Return Process
* If the buyer wants to return the product, the delivery boy scans the QR code.
* The system checks the blockchain record to verify the product details.

### 6.Verification Results
* ‚úÖ Product Match (Success) ‚Üí If details match the blockchain record, return is accepted.
   * Message: ‚ÄúProduct Verification Success‚Äù
* ‚ùå Product Mismatch (Failed) ‚Üí If details do not match, return is rejected.
   * Message: ‚ÄúReturn Initiated ‚Äì Product Mismatch‚Äù

## 7.Proof & Transparency
* Each scan generates a new verification hash.
* This hash is sent to the seller via WhatsApp, providing proof of the product‚Äôs authenticity or mismatch.
* Both seller and buyer have a tamper-proof blockchain record of the transaction.

## ‚ö° End Result:
* Sellers are protected from fake returns.
* Buyers get transparent return verification.
* The system ensures trust, security, and accountability in e-commerce returns.

üìù Note
  * Every product registered in this system is linked with a unique Order ID, Product ID, Brand, and Seller Wallet Address stored on the blockchain
  * The QR code attached to the product acts as a digital authenticity tag.
  * Do not remove or damage the QR code. If the tag is missing or tampered with, the return and refund request will not be accepted.
  * During a return, the delivery agent must scan the QR code to verify details.
  * Return is only successful if the scanned details match the blockchain record. Otherwise, the system will reject the return automatically.
  * All transactions and verifications generate immutable blockchain records, ensuring security, trust, and transparency for both buyers and sellers.
